This is for when you wanna check which sound event i replaced, and you can view the mod's contents itself to find out how much to replaced in details


1p: first person 
3p: third person aka everyone else but yours
3p enemy: same as 3p but only enemies can play those sounds

i will include 1p or 3p if it's exclusive to that perspective, otherwise assume it can play for both 1p and 3p
