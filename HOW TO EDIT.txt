 -To disable an event from playing any sounds (will be replaced with vanilla sounds), rename the files that have ".json" with ".txt" or delete it
    For example "titan_1p_warpfall_start.json" to "titan_1p_warpfall_start.txt". You can keep the folder of the same name 
       intact, it only contains .wav files.


  -To disable a specific sound from playing, go into the specific folder and remove that specific audio file, this can be done 
  by putting the .wav file outside it's folder or deleting it outright if you do not want it.
     (if the sound folder only has 1 file, you can also disable/delete the json file)


  -You can disable the whole mod itself in the in-game mod menu or go into the "enabledmods.json" located in 
      Titanfall2\R2Northstar, find the mod's name, it should be "Goofy ahh sound pack" and change it from "true" to "false"
      Or with mod manager, idk i never use them for Northstar.


  -Some audio can be quite loud, it was made so that you can actually hear them in the game properly, do take caution and 
      lower your volume when previewing some of the sounds here.
